Everywhere, people have stayed and lived before us. At Lake Tulebo, archaeologists have found exciting findings in the soil. During the Bronze Age, there were fires burning in long lines along the ridge, above what is now the beach.

Bring your mobile and go for a walk next to the lake. Here you step into the virtual spaces that tell of the history of the place. New worlds are opened in the surroundings, based on what we know - and do not know - about the fire pits where the fires were lit several thousand years ago.

ENTER Mölndal is a site-specific interactive experience - through your mobile phone!

The first place you get to meet the [Kvarnbyn](en/kvarnbyn/), where the rapids has given people the opportunity to live, survive, work and create more than 600 years. 

On 22 September we are launching the next experience: [ENTER Mölndal - Tulebosjön](en/tulebosjon) - an app for the family and children from 9 years, which tells of the unique prehistoric finds at Lake Tulebo.

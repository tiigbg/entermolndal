Take a walk in Kvarnbyn and learn about the industrial history through a streamed experience in your web browser or an app for iPhone. Or bring your mobile to lake Tulebosjön and explore the site's exciting ancient history with an AR app.

Throughout the landscape, there are traces of people who lived here before us. Some traces are visible, while others are almost impossible to discover. Through your mobile phone, you can now enter the many layers of history. ENTER Mölndal can be experienced at two sites: [Kvarnbyn](en/kvarnbyninfo/) in Mölndal and by the lake [Tulebosjön](en/tulebosjon/) in Kållered.

#### **About the sites**
In [Kvarnbyn](en/kvarnbyninfo/) the Mölndal river and rapids have given people the chance to live, survive, work and create for over a thousand years. You will discover the site through voices and stories from different times. You take part of the experience through the browser in your mobile phone or through the app ENTER Mölndal – Kvarnbyn for iPhone. It is suitable for users who are 14 years or older. 

By lake [Tulebosjön](en/tulebosjon/) archaeologists have found extraordinary traces from the Bronze age. During excavations in 1998 an entire system of pits was discovered, where fires were lit several thousand years ago! In an app for iPhone and Android, you will explore the site's history and enter virtual rooms. This AR-experience and guided tour is suitable for users who are nine years or older.

#### **About the Project**
ENTER Mölndal has been developed by [Mölndals stadsmuseum](https://museum.molndal.se/) in collaboration with [RISE Interactive](https://www.tii.se/) and [Marika Hedemyr Projects](http://www.marikahedemyr.com/). The project has been realized with the generous support of [The Torsten Söderberg Foundation](http://www.torstensoderbergsstiftelse.se/). [More information.](about/)
